A separate data structure takes observations and strings them together into observation chains. These are lists of sequential observations, which will be used to create transitions of multiple steps. This object will accept observations from the env loop
and will spit out observation chains when possible. It is possible to do this when n observations have been fed into the object.
When a terminal state is reached, there will be no more observations given to the object, and so it must flush its buffer to 
prepare for the next run of the environment. This is done by filling in
